# Section 1 Introduction
Executive Summary
HLC Foundation (HalalChain) is a public chain based on DAG technology to serve the global Islamic economy and serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. Subject to design, HalalChain is inherently resistant to modification of the data and connects the other consortium blockchain in various jurisdictions through cross-chain protocol. 
In Halal industry it focuses on building alliance chains of traceability of halal products; And in Islamic finance industry, it mainly concentrates on developing Islamic financial products and stable cryptocurrency; All above is striving to establish an ecosystem combined with development of the underlying technologies and practical applications.
HLC is building advanced blockchain based platform for Islamic economy ecosystem that will allow users investors to easily engage in the trading their ecosystem tokens using various payment methods. HLC Foundation’s goal is to provide and promote the mass adoption of Blockchain technologies by becoming a globally trusted service provider. In various segment of Islamic economy ecosystem. To this end, HLC have created a unique solutions with relevant regulatory compliances built into the products and services to be offered in Islamic economy ecosystem.
Today, the world has experienced half a decade of mainstream Blockchain applicable use cases, and HLC are at the verge of starting  the mature enterprise blockchain era. A major strength of all Blockchain solutions revolves around their promising impact on a global financial scale. Within this context, HLC strongly believe that Blockchain solutions in the global Islamic economy ecosystem which are compliant with the Shariah regulatory or enterprise technology by consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs, and as such HLC is offering a flexible platform to the Islamic economy ecosystem.

## About HLC Foundation (HalalChain)

HalalChain is the first public blockchain company that focuses on serving Muslim countries and regions. By implementing blockchain technology into the Halal supply chain and Islamic financial industry they will help to increase transparency and traceability in Islamic financial products and services, traceability of halal and healthy products, Zakat donations, heritage and property registration, cultural communication etc.

HalalChain is built on the new distributed ledger Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This underlying technology, guarantees security and decentralization by achieving “High Throughput”. By combining the advanced DAG technology with unique application scenarios we are able to build across the multi-layer payment system within the Islamic economy ecosystem.

HLC foundation Limited is a public company limited by guarantee specialized in Blockchain Technologies.  HLC foundation has issued the Tokens and completed the ICOs in the jurisdiction of Singapore.

## Overview of HLC public chain
HLC public chain could set up a new trading platform (or move across an existing trading platform) on a blockchain protocol. Blockchain technology offers the potential to support a new medium to exchange assets without centralized trusts or intermediaries—and without the risk of double spending. As already discussed, blockchain can eliminate the threat or the risk of fraud in all areas of banking, and this could equally apply to a trading platform. Furthermore, blockchain would also address issues such as operational risk and administrative costs as it can be made transparent and immutable. The traceability and the permanent historic record that would exist on the blockchain backing up every asset or item of value that was traded, would provide assurance and authenticity all the way through the supply chain. A public chain has various performance metrics, in developing this public chain HLC take into consideration various factors which are confirmation time, security including decetrialization degree and faulty tolerance threshold and high throuput. Specificly:
### Fast confirmation time
Confirmation time is the waiting time when user has high confidence that a transaction being confirmed permanently, which means it can not be overun by malicious users. Confirmation time is the most important  factor in terms of user expirence, people don't have patience to bear long time confirmation. Comparing to bitcoin, HLC needs to wait for 6 blocks i.e. 1 hour to reach secure confirmation. HLC is leveraging the fast confirmation feature in SPECTRE protocol and would be able to achive promising confirmation in order of seconds, meaning less than 1 minute, even less than 10 seconds when there is no active attack.

### High security
#### Fully decentrialized
Decetrialization is the soul of a public blockchain because this is what the trust comes from for an fully autonomous system. Numbers of projects sacrifice their dectrialization to gain better throughput because of less consensus workload. This is a risky trade-off becuase less nodes to participate in consensus would bring higher possiblility to be targeted by attackers and prone to make collusion. HLC's consensus protocol SPECTRE is fully decentrailized, so all nodes have full ledger and there are no super nodes.
#### 50 % faulty tolerance threshold
Faulty tolerance is refering the percentage of incapable nodes: including malicious nodes and non-operational nodes. For an autonomous network, it obeys the marjority law, so 50% would be the highest standard. HLC has the same 50% faulty tolerance threshold with bitcoin, so HLC can provides as much security as bitcoin.

### High throughput
Throughput is a repsentative metric of scalabilty, also it is a strong factor affecing practical scenarios. Bitcoin and ethereum don't scale, which have only 7 TPS and 15 TPS in theory. As a global value transfer network, such low throughput limits the vairious applications. HLC is using Block DAG as our ledger underlying data structure and it could provde a conservative estimation of at least one thousand transaction per second throughput to meet most applications on blockchain so far.

This white paper proposes an alternative to traditional applications and use cases currently used to support the issuance Islamic securities (Smart Sukuk) in the Islamic capital markets industry. Instead of physical certificates/notes, Sukuk can be represented digitally in a public permissioned ledger using Blockchain in HLC Smart Sukuk platform.

## Methodology 
Blockchain has a big picture and HLC think that it requres an architecture to undertake. The ideaology of Blockchain technology is value transfer, so this paper firstly focuses on this point and make it better than all public chains so far, then on top of that, we will extend it with much functionalities like virtual machines for smart contracts.

### Respect classic
Bitcoin has various challenges so far, like scability, like centralization due to monopolized mining pools. However, most of its mechanisms are long time proved robust and promising. So HLC adopted most of its classical designs, like UTXO, like Proof of work.

### Embrace innovation
HLC acknowledge that there is no perfect in the innovation technology, and Bitcoin is not perfect. As it just mentioned, scability and centralization, in addition, long confirmation time is also a big problem in confirming the transactions. So HLC is facing these challenges and solve it with the new Block DAG protocols, SPECTRE and SPECTRE.
### Simple and extensible
The scenarios in blockchain are complex and we won't solve all of them in a single complex system, which is probably unmaintainable. Instead, we design an extensilbe architect, each layer of which is simple enought to solve only a core problem. Moreover, communications are through flexible interfaces between layers. For instance, public chain is a strong foundamental value transfer network and we will make off-chain smart contracts solution on top of it. Another case is we are using block DAG to gain suffienct scalabilty for current application scenarios, since it is a leger tech, it natually could combine Sharding and layer 2 scalabilty solution to provide further scalability.
