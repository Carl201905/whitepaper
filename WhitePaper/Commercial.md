Introduction 
HLC public chain could set up a new trading platform (or move across an existing trading platform) on a blockchain protocol. Blockchain technology offers the potential to support a new medium to exchange assets without centralized trusts or intermediaries—and without the risk of double spending. As already discussed, blockchain can eliminate the threat or the risk of fraud in all areas of banking, and this could equally apply to a trading platform. Furthermore, blockchain would also address issues such as operational risk and administrative costs as it can be made transparent and immutable. The traceability and the permanent historic record that would exist on the blockchain backing up every asset or item of value that was traded, would provide assurance and authenticity all the way through the supply chain. This, again, will be determined by the advances in technology needed to speed blockchain transactions.
This white paper proposes an alternative to traditional applications currently used to support the issuance Islamic securities (Smart Sukuk) in the Islamic capital markets industry. Instead of physical certificates/notes, Sukuk can be represented digitally in a public permissioned ledger using Blockchain in HLC Smart Sukuk platform.

Philosophy of Islamic economy in Blockchain Technology
The main efforts in Islamic economics so far has been to create new forms Shariah compliance instruments to operationalise Shariah and ethical values into the current conventional economic system and financial services products. While this is crucial to sustain the global economy as it is today, the Islamic economics needs to develop new strategies to cope with the next economy, which starts with a clear and deliverable vision of a new world economy. And the new vision of a new world economy will be driven by those who embrace innovation that will build the future. 

However, it is necessary to look at the main building block to enable trust in impersonal financial transactions in a highly globalized society. This innovation called the “blockchain” will play a crucial role in boosting the Islamic financial sectors in all its segments which include banking, insurance, Capital market, Zakah and Waqf management. Addressing the digital revolution that is happening right now will foster competitive advantage for the Islamic economy and finance industry. This innovation is in accordance with Shariah rules and principles
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority. Simply put, it is a mechanism for creating trust. Within this open ledger system, the blockchain offers an inherent level of trust for the user, eliminating the need for the middleman and mitigating the risk of human error. Justice and creditworthiness has been emphasized in the Holy Quran in Surat al Nisa which Allah says: 
O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care of both. So do not follow your desires, lest you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away—then God is Aware of what you do” (4:135)
In the blockchain transaction, it is publicly accessible log of transactions ensures that the data is protected against tampering and revision, and it is virtually impossible for individuals to modify or replace parts of the blockchain secretly. The need for transparency, justice is, above all, an important Sharī`ah consideration in blockchain transaction. Any form of concealment, fraud or attempt at misrepresentation violates the principles of justice and fairness in Sharī`ah as mentioned in the Qur’an in Sūrah Al-Mutaffifin: 
Woe to the defrauders. Those who, when they take a measure from people, they take in full. But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat. (83: 1-3)
A full copy of the blockchain contains every transaction ever executed, making information on the value belonging to every active address (account) accessible at any point in history. Every block contains a long reference number or hash of the previous block, thus creating a chain of blocks from the genesis block to the current block. The below paragraphs explain the concept of blockchain and how a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, based on the cryptocurrency protocol.
 

The HLC public chain platform is one of the latest underlying technologies based on Directed Acyclic Graph which has been defined as Blockchain 3.0 technology. The DAG involves and supports quick transactions, and is friendly to small payment. This innovation shows that there is correlation between revealing civilization and blockchain consensus, which is transparency, justice, creditworthiness, trust and witness described in the Holy Quran and shared by the whole humanity. The public blockchain could act as a complete set of ecosystems to support start-ups in the Islamic digital economy and beyond. The project is expected to generate a market capitalization of 20Billion company in Dubai upon the successful delivery of public blockchain. Certain segments within Islamic finance has been too caught up in Shari'ah-compliance debate instead of recognizing that we are at the cusps of an economic evolution. The industry should also recognize that these technological advancements are essentially aligned to the principles of the Shari'ah that requires and upholds the values of trust, honesty and transparency.


Applicable Use Cases of HLC public chain

It is mentioned that innovation is important as the humanity are living in the age of technology and in an era of extreme innovation; with every passing day human being are harnessing new possibilities and existing opportunities using technology. Nowadays, one of the most talked-about topics in the financial services industry is to enable Capital markets, money markets and banks to process payments more quickly and more accurately while reducing the costs of processing transactions. However, The technology could be adopted in the area of Stable coin, sukuk, takaful, banking, waqf, zakat,etc.

Use Case: Stable Coin

A stable coin is a currency which successfully performs its functions as a means of exchange, unit of account and a store of value because its purchasing power is stable. but is not tied to a central bank and has low volatility. On any given day, it is common to see an increase to 10-20% or even a decrease. That makes using most cryptocurrencies for daily transactions inconvenient. The adoption of stable currencies/coins will be a catalyst to the new decentralized internet becoming mainstream.
Stable coins is  core product is a Shariah compliant smart contract that represents an equity stake in Sukuk portfolio, which successfully combines traditional Islamic finance principles with those of mainstream finance. Stable Coin is a token whose smart contract represents the owners’ share in a financial fund formed by investment grade Sukuk. When consumers purchase the token, they are buying in to a fund of diversified Sukuk of high quality and high liquidity Sukuk.


Features Of The Stable Coin 
 
Currency & Security As a currency, Fasset is a system that enables payments settlement between two parties, directly, without the need of a central party to monitor transactions. Also, as a security, Fasset is backed by investment grade Sukuk that allows the token to not only remain stable, but steadily appreciate in value, making it ideal as a savings instrument. Fasset carries divisibility, homogeneity, portability and stability due to its asset-backed nature.

Equity and Debt  
As a token, Stable Coin represents an owner’s equity stake in a financial fund that is comprised of investment grade sukuk. We estimate that this fixed-income product will, return between 3-7% for retail investors, which is the average range for high quality sovereign and private Sukuk issuance. At the peak of its development, Fasset will also be able to support the raising of Shariah-Compliant debt for both corporates and sovereigns through its wider community of retail and institutional investors.  

Stability  
The final feature of the coin is in its stability. Backed by a real asset, the coin will not be subject to huge variations in price and thus will in effect become a form of stable coin. Coins will be issued 1:1 against the value of the sukuk fund.

Applicable uses of Stable Coin 
The use of Blockchain technology holds great potential across the Islamic economy and finance industry. One of the key principles of Islamic economy is based on having enforceable contracts which are fair, transparent and agreeable between the parties that engage in a banking transaction.
Payments  
As a currency, Stable currency can be a payments system for goods and services. The Shariah-compliance and homogeneity offered by Fasset can form as a reliable and low cost payments settlement vehicle for SMEs and large companies. 
Transfers 
Our ecosystem will provide the infrastructure for an instantaneous international transfer system. The stability, portability and real world liquidity of Fasset will allow for fast, cost-less remittances across borders – especially given the fact that the Fasset ecosystem will be built on the DAG protocol (see Section 3: Technology Context for more information).  
Savings 
As of now, retail customers are unable to access the Sukuk market for long term savings - Fasset will democratize access to a Shariah compliant fixed-income investment fund for retail consumers. The fixed-income nature of Sukuk and the divisibility offered by Fasset will allow retail investors to transfer their savings into Fasset for safe, secure and steady returns. 
Liquid asset  
Stable Coin can replace commodities such as copper that are required for debt based Shariah financing. Thus, Fasset can accommodate many real-life transactions, for instances al Murabahah, Tawarruq, etc. 
Liquidity management  
Perhaps the most important use case for the Fasset ecosystem will be in playing a vital role as a much-needed and oft-requested secondary market for the Islamic Finance industry. The speed, security and cost savings from encoding smart contracts using distributed ledger technology will provide strong options for liquidity management. This will enable numerous functions that have so far stalled the growth of Islamic Finance – such as inter-bank lending, monetary supply management by central banks and in enabling the development of other bespoke Shariah compliant institutional products.

Smart Sukuk on HLC public chain
One important application in Islamic capital markets for blockchain is the sukuk (Islamic bonds) market. Sukuk are securitized, and hence tradable on secondary markets much like a stock can be traded on a stock exchange. Islamic finance prohibits interest payments on loans and the sale of debt; Sukuk markets evolved to securitize Islamic modes of financing such as profit sharing through asset ownership for a given tenure.
Sukuk has been a popular approach for governments seeking to finance infrastructure projects, but the legal complexity and overall cost to issue sukuk has kept it out of reach for smaller corporations and MSMEs. It has been an excellent way to raise much needed capital, but investors have also been always restricted to the much larger institutional investors due to the high barrier of entry, which usually starts in the millions. However, the inability to lower these barriers of entry at the retail level to thousands or hundreds of dollars to enable wider participation (and access to more funds) for sukuk participation, and hence wider risk and profit-sharing in the Islamic capital market, is still persistent and remains an impediment to true shared prosperity.

Sukuk investment: An Ethical Investment For  stable  Returns
According to IFSB 9 (IFSB, 2007) Sukuk commonly refers to the Islamic bonds. However, as opposed to conventional bonds, which merely confer ownership of a debt, Sukuk grants the investor a share of an asset, along with the commensurate cash flows and risk. As such, Sukuk securities adhere to Islamic law, referred to as Shari’ah principles, which prohibit the charging or payment of interest.

Put simply, Sukuk instruments act as a bridge. They link their issuers, primarily sovereigns and corporations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, with a wide pool of investors, many of whom are seeking to diversify their holdings beyond traditional asset classes. In this way, funds raised through Sukuk can be allocated in an efficient and transparent way to infrastructure initiatives and other deserving projects linked directly to the real economy sector.

Development of Traditional Sukuk market 
2017 ended on an optimistic note for the global Sukuk market. There were relatively higher commodity prices (particularly of oil), a gradual rise of reference rates, and a marked increase in Sovereign Sukuk issuances, stable Corporate Sukuk issuances in certain jurisdictions and a healthy Sukuk issuance pipeline. Sukuk continued to gain attention from new issuers while the investor base expanded, which is an encouraging development. During the year, Sukuk were issued as a viable alternative source of financing for infrastructure development, aircraft financing, project financing, corporate general purpose needs, capital adequacy and budgetary requirements. Other interesting developments are the issuance of Green Sukuk and increased interest in SRI Sukuk issuances.

The year’s landmark event was Saudi Arabia’s entry as a sovereign Sukuk issuer. The country’s first issuance was the largest international Sukuk issuance ever of USD 9 billion, followed by several sovereign domestic Sukuk issuances. The other new sovereign issuer was Nigeria with the country’s domestic issuance being around USD 312 million. In addition, continued interest from well established sovereign, quasi sovereign and financial institutions issuers such as the Governments of Bahrain, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Oman, Hong Kong, Investment Corporation of Dubai, and Islamic Development Bank has kept the Sukuk market active. New issuers, such as Saudi Arabia, have helped keep the growth trajectory of Sukuk issuance intact.


Global Sukuk Issuances
Total global issuance amounted to USD 116.7 billion in 2017. As illustrated in Chart 1 below, global Sukuk issuance has increased from USD 87.9 billion in 2016 to USD 116.7 billion in 2017, an impressive jump of around 32% in volume. The increase in volume during 2017 was mainly due to sovereign Sukuk issuances by Saudi Arabia coupled with steady issuances from Asia, GCC, Africa and certain other jurisdictions. Malaysia continues to dominate the Sukuk market, though shares from countries like Indonesia, the UAE and to some extent from Turkey, are close behind in value.


Table : Total Global Sukuk Issuances (Jan 2001 - Dec 2017) All Tenors, All Currencies, In USD Millions
 


International Sukuk Issuances
The international Sukuk market, though it forms just under 22.3% of overall Global Sukuk issuances since 2001, is the real attraction and driver of the Sukuk market. Denominated in USD and other stable currencies, the international Sukuk issues are being issued in longer tenors which include up to 30 years, perpetual, and there is an indication from Malaysia that a 50  years Sukuk issuance is on the cards. The international Sukuk with medium to long term tenors maintained growth in volume during 2017; the size of international short term Sukuk remained stable mainly due to issuances by IILM.
In recent years, sovereign and quasi-sovereign issuances are on the rise and forms the bulk of the Sukuk market. 
Total international Sukuk issuances stood at USD 37.6 billion in 2017 which translate into an increase of USD 6.4 billion from the 2016 level of USD 31.2 billion – this is so far the highest value of international Sukuk issuance recorded since the inception of the Sukuk market.

Sukuk - has thus far been limited to governments and large institutions due to the high issuing costs and complexity. But there is new approach and innovation in Islamic Economy from HLC perspective aims to using the blockchain. Using blockchain technology can solve most of the Shariah and legal  issues in the Sukuk issuance. Islamic Securities can be executed according to predefined rules can be coded as a smart contract in capital markets. 
Experiments are ongoing on the issuance of smart bonds. Sukuk issuance follows strictly Shariah law and principles of permissible variance, cleansing, the balance-sheet ratios to be satisfied, the 'conglomerate' issue and the 'core' activities. The following Table shows the traditional Sukuk 

 




These Smart Sukuk can also be coded as if-then statements to ensure both compliance to the Shariah and transparency for all involved. This would increase the investors satisfactions on the Shariah compliance of Sukuk product.
Smart Sukuk standardizes and automates much of the legal, accounting, and payment overhead of conventional sukuk offerings - all backed by fully licensed legal entities in the issuing jurisdiction.

Smart Contract and Blockchain 
The role of smart contracts in the smart Sukuk.  A smart contract is a piece of code within a blockchain record that is executed by each node on the network to automate (potentially) a particular state resulting from a contractual deliverable without further human interaction. For example, in the context of a loan or a bond you could put in place a smart contract at the time of issue that automates the payment of interest to each investor on the given due dates. Accordingly, the bond or loan would service itself when triggered by the borrower sending funds to the smart contract. It is therefore a very useful tool to automate operative parts of normal legal contracts, but all the regular contractual protections such as representations, warranties and indemnities drafted in natural language are still needed. These cannot currently be replaced with code It’s fair to say there is some confusion and concern about smart contracts among lawyers with many concerned that regular natural language contracts will be replaced by code. This is not currently viable or realistic. Smart contracts are not a replacement for normal legal contracts but rather sit behind and augment a legal contract where by snippets of code replicate and automatically perform certain terms of the contract.

The Investors in a sukuk are issued a share of ownership, which represents their fractional ownership in the underlying asset or structure with the terms of the sukuk ownership. Holders of sukuk receive periodic payments from the fund-raising institution. Investors can hold a sukuk until maturity, or they can sell their ownership in the sukuk to a third party. This subsequent sale to a third party is known as “secondary trading” and is what distinguishes a sukuk as a “securitized” asset.
Smart Sukuk runs on the Ethereum blockchain, which supports “smart contracts”. A smart contract encodes business rules directly into the underlying payment currency itself – the blockchain itself enforces the contract rules regarding payments and transfer of ownership.

Smart Sukuk Definition 
The experimental bond was also issued by Fasset  through HLC’s public chain platform, but this is new  denominated in ether. As such, it will be the first ever cryptocurrency Sukuk fully settled on an open public blockchain using smart contracts. While cryptocurrency Sukuk have been issued under crypto asset conditions, and there have been some bonds issued where payment has been made in cryptocurrency, this was the first time a Sukuk has actually been denominated in cryptocurrency, fully settled on a blockchain and issued on a commercial basis by a trading company in a regulated way. It is significant because HLC foundation will able, for the first time, to issue and pay for a legally enforceable financial instrument without using any of the traditional existing financial infrastructure.
Smart Sukuk, can be defined as tokenization by collecting funds from investors in exchange for Sukuk Tokens representing an ownership portion of the Sukuk investment. When the institution makes payments, the funds are automatically distributed back to the Sukuk Token holders via the blockchain according to the rules of the smart contract in Islamic Economics - without the need of conventional banks or intermediaries.
Smart Sukuk is where the investors transferred Ether from their existing blockchain wallets, such as a Coinbase account, to their HLC cryptocurrency wallets. On settlement, ether passed from investors’ cryptocurrency wallet addresses to Fasset’s address, and the Sukuk passed from Fasset’sIslamic securities wallet address to the investors’ addresses. All of this is recorded on the public blockchain technology and represented through the HLC public blockchain interface on the HLC platform. 

 
From a Islamic securities perspective, the blockchain served as the register and denoted legal and beneficial ownership. Because the Financial Authority recognised the blockchain as an independent third party, there was no need for a registrar to keep a register of Sukuk holders: the register is the blockchain. Smart contract code was put in place behind the regular legal contracts to automate delivery of the Sukuk and payment flows, so Fasset issued the smart Sukuk and paid investors’ returns and principal automatically, without further action.
Smart Sukuk Tokens support an industry standard protocol, called ERC20. The standard allows tokens to be traded globally on a variety of public cryptocurrency exchanges.

Shariah law is a Must for Smart Sukuk
Islamic Economics and finance is bound by Shariah rules and regulations from the regulatory authorities. A recent working paper written by Prof. Abdussalam and published by University Utara Malaysia notes that cryptocurrency like HLC token and Ethereum in Islamic Economy is permissible based on its attributes and underlying asset which is HLC commodity.
The Halalchain will offer the Smart Sukuk in jurisdictions with clear and viable legal and regulatory frameworks to support the issuance of Smart Sukuk. The structure of the Sukuk above will be base on Sukuk Ijarah and hybrid Sukuk projects “Take sukuk al-ijarah (lease based) as an example – an Sukuk ijarah is permissible and Shariah compliance if the true ownership of the underlying asset is legally transferred to the Sukuk holders. And for a Smart Sukuk, it’s only acceptable because of its regulation on trading and exchange in the Cryptocurrency Assets.”

The project's hybrid operating model and technological neutrality enable this functionality regard - less of the development course of international crypto asset regulations. The project system will, privately and independently, consolidate the functions usually included in the mandate of national central banks, i.e. the functions of the issuing center and the settlement and clearing system. This will allow HLC foundation to implement a new business model, acting as a "cloud" solution to Malaysia government. The project system will correspond to the image of Islamic economic power by Blockchain as a global hyperobject that is spread across countries and continents without a single center of power. The HLC project's humanitarian mission will show itself in unifying the global Ummah around the agenda of establishing a socially responsible financial system which can assist any Islamic country in the financial crisis. The introduction of Islamic business ethics into the practice of everyday financial behavior will increase financial inclusion and de - marginalize the least well -off Muslims in the Middle East and Western countries. This project offers alternative eco - nomic development  for the Malaysian government that is more sustainable and, ultimately, more socially just.
Smart Sukuk supports issuance of the sukuk in global/local currencies and eliminates the need for institutions to add cryptocurrency to their balance sheet. The use of blockchain allows for legal and beneficial title to be united. This meant that the global/definitive note structure that underpins most Islamic securities issuance was dispensed with, removing a lot of the detailed language that first-time issuers often struggle with.

Features of Smart Sukuk 
A stable currency is a currency which successfully performs its functions as a means of exchange, unit of account and a store of value because its purchasing power is stable. but is not tied to a central bank and has low volatility. On any given day, it is common to see an increase to 10-20% or even a decrease. That makes using most cryptocurrencies for daily transactions inconvenient. The adoption of stable currencies/coins will be a catalyst to the new decentralized internet becoming mainstream.

Sukuk issuance on Blockchain simplifies Islamic securities issuance and reduces cost in a number of ways: .

Firstly, it means legal fees and complexity are both lessened because the documents and structure are simpler. As described above, the use of   blockchain allows for legal and beneficial title to be united. This meant that the global/definitive note structure that underpins most securities issuance was dispensed with, removing a lot of the detailed language that first-time issuers often struggle with. 

Secondly, the absence of a registrar meant that the normal contractual relationships that needs to be created between issuer and registrar could be dispensed with, and the issuer does not need to pay a registrar to perform the function. Thirdly, payments could be made on a peer to peer basis ie the issuer pays interest and principal directly to investors automatically via the use of smart contracts. Accordingly, there was no need to have a paying agent, which again reduced the complexity of the documentation and also meant that the issuer did not need to pay a large bank to fulfil the role. Finally, on the investor side, the ease with which someone can open a blockchain wallet means that there is less need for a long chain of custody.

As a result there were fewer parties involved and substantially shorter and less complex bond documents. This reduces the cost and time to market for issuers and it should be clear from the structure diagram below how much simpler this is than the traditional structures described above.
It is important to note too that any party can independently verify the allocation of cash and assets on the blockchain without using HalalChain’s system. This is important, because if the system were to fall away for any reason, the contracts could still be enforced as between holders and the issuer. Enforcement would work in much the same manner as a regular bond issuance. For this issuance Link acted as trustee so if there were to be an event of default then holders would be able to enforce their rights via the trustee in the usual fashion and ultimately through the courts. On an issuance without a trustee, bondholders would be able to enforce rights directly. Smart contracts do not change or diminish enforcement rights, there were still regular legal contracts that any capital markets lawyer and the courts would recognise, understand.

Smart Takaful : use case on HLC public chain
As a niche section of the insurance sector, the takaful segment is significantly impacted by the disruptions occurring within the insurance sector. The global insurance market had a reasonable growth rate, with global real premium growth rates of 2.9% in the advanced economies and 7.4% in the emerging and developing countries in 2014, an improvement over the 2012 and 2013 rates (IFSB, 2016). Likewise, the growth rate of gross contributions in the takaful sector demonstrated a recovery in 2014 from 2013, when the growth rate of premiums was by far the lowest historically.
Takaful is a system of Islamic insurance based on the principle of mutual cooperation and donation (Tabarru), where the risk is shared collectively and voluntarily among the participants. Takaful claims, is a distributed process that involves many parties, participant, Takaful Operator and beneficiary, often with insufficient transparency to the participants. 

Smart contracts deployed through the blockchain will provide customers and takaful (insurance) Operators a system to manage claims in a transparent, quick, and indisputable manner. Takaful policies, along with its terms and conditions, and potential claims can be recorded onto the blockchain and validated by the network, ensuring valid claims are dispensed and false claims are rejected.  For example, the blockchain will reject multiple claims for one accident because the network would know that a claim has already been made. Smart contracts would also process claims efficiently by triggering payments automatically when certain conditions are met and validated. To more effectively detect identity fraud, falsified injury or damage reports, etc., blockchain can be used as a cross- Islamic Financial Institutions (Islamic Finance industry).

Takaful claims processing and settlement, are areas where participants make a contribution and the Takaful operator sets out rules under which, the participant gets a coverage. The level of expertise required for claim adjusters or the investigators, who investigate, negotiate and settle claims, varies directly with the nature of loss, under the jurisdiction whose law applies to the contract creation, interpretation and enforcement, one of principal consumer protection issues within the Takaful pricing, underwriting, and claim settlement process, the rules-based claims processing or otherwise a voting based claims processing, mostly followed by mutual agreement. 
The settlements are also subject to interpretation of the rules that apply to the product and participant situation. This leads the claim processor to apply rules and make decisions before paying out the claim. Storing and reconciling data sets of financial obligations and ownership forms are the core of Takaful claims operations. The current methods are highly complex, use fragmented IT and data architectures and suffer from a lack of common standards. This creates a continual need to reconcile data with massive systems and process duplication, leading to high costs and protracted time to execute tasks. Block-chain can be used to manage shared intelligence and could be used to drive efficiency in Takaful claims processing independent of fraud, thus bringing a structural change to the industry. 
Further, in lines of Takaful where losses require onsite examination, claims adjusters may be sent to conduct an investigation. Takaful smart claim (TSC), through the block-chain-based systems could help radically improve the Takaful company operations in term of efficient claim processing and settlements, claims adjusters’ investigation and decisions on which claim should be paid, with the means to manage claims in a transparent, responsive and irrefutable manner. These features or innovation could be built into the Takaful existing market infrastructure in making the claim, it would allow for the auto-execution of coded logic embedded into smart claims.
The block-chain lets people who have no particular confidence in each other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority. Simply put, it is a mechanism for creating trust. Within this open ledger system, the block-chain offers an inherent level of trust for the user, eliminating the need for the middleman and mitigating the risk of human error. Thus, it promotes justice and creditworthiness which has been emphasized in the Holy Quran in Surat al Nisa (4:135)
In this innovation, block-chain transactions can be a reversed engineered to allow a pretty good guess at the transactor. Another block-chain virtue is the decentralization of customer databases and a federated identity infrastructure that allows an individual to identify information online without having to supply personal information (for example, a driver’s license number to multiple Takaful operator). Rather than being held in any number of central databases, sensitive data is encrypted and distributed and a block-chain is used as an audit ledger to re-authenticate the user. 
 

Alongside big data, mobile and digital technologies, Takaful smart claim is essential to establishing an efficient, transparent and customer-focused claims model based on higher degrees of trust and transparency. Within claims prevention, new data streams can enhance the risk selection process by combining location, external risk and analytics. A distributed ledger can enable the TO and various participants to easily and instantly access and update relevant information (e.g., claim forms, evidence, police reports and third-party review reports). 
The use of data from a mobile phone or sensors can streamline claims submission, reduce loss adjuster costs and increase customer satisfaction, with block-chain systems facilitating communications and coordination among all parties. Consider how sensors can trigger alerts to TO that a crash has occurred (thereby initiating a new claim), and then route secure and relevant data to preapprove and conveniently locate medical teams, towing services and/or repair garages. Here again, block-chain is the network connecting and ordering data from the multiple devices and apps involved in the multidimensional process. 
This Smart Takaful will help the Takaful operator to record transactions on a block-chain at each point in the transactional lifecycle, from seeking a quotation to binding contract, the immutable life record of that contribution of participant can be traced. This does bring a degree of simplicity to the underwriting process and has the potential to reduce fraud. The main purpose of Takaful is to provide assistance to the participants when they are in any difficulties or losses, such mutual assistance will be significantly achieved by the means of automated Takaful claim processes that are efficient, transparent, faster, cheaper and more secure by adopting block-chain technology.
Waqf Chain Endowment
In the Islamic Finance, there is a particular opportunity in Waqf’s tremendous potential and development. For decades, the administration of Waqf assets has been a challenge in Islamic Economics and finance. Billions of Waqf funds/assets globally that could be used to education and alleviate poverty, are simply not being utilized efficiently. However, the advent of blockchain technology has brought hope and optimism to Waqf administrators and Shariah scholars in Islamic Economy. 
In 2010, Ernst & Young estimated the global WAQF sector to be worth over US 105 billion. Informal estimates by experts suggest that Waqf assets could be as high as SAR 1 trillion (US266.6) in Saudi Arabia alone, while in Malaysia, Waqf assets have been estimated at RM1 trillion (US325.4 billion), and in Egypt a recent report by ministry of Religious Endowment estimated Waqf endowments of around US 82 billion. HLC has identifies endowment as an underserved market niche commensurate with its vocation to be the social Solution for Blockchain.
 
With the use of continuous innovations and disruptions happening in the financial and technological, Islamic economics, including Waqf principles are being forced to maneuver and reinvent themselves, especially in terms of governance and regulations so as to remain relevant since they constitute a major socio economic institution in the modern financial market.
HLC intends to provide a smart contract ecosystem and accompanying blockchain to allow Waqf boards and other interested stakeholders the opportunity to submit project outlines/plans in order to fund and develop projects on top of Waqf properties.
