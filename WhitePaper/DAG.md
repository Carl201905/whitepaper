## Public Chain
### Introduction
HLC public chain is a common block DAG framework, it seperates consensus layer, which is usually mutable in different scenarios,  from foundamental and is open to developers. 
## Methodology
### Vision
HLC's vision is always simple, we just want to build a practical and usable public chain based on our traditional value of blockchain - decentrailzed, secure and scalable. 
### What problem ?
Bitcoin just passed her 10 years birthday without severe problems, the most urgent issue is sacalability. The current average transaction rate of bitcoin is lower than 5, as a global payment solution, this performance is far behind our expectation, not to mention that people find the underlying technolgy blockchain - a  dectrentrailzed temper-proof ledger - might solve trust problems in a large number of industries. 

The other problem is the trend of centralization. Bitcoin was born with decentralization, which is the main source of its security. You may imagine some blockchain had a really high hash power threshold, say 99%, but was controlled in just a few hands, so their high security threshold didn't mean anything if we had broken down these owners. 

Current bitcoin is against its original will and is controlled in a small bunch of mining pools, the top 5 pools take up the 90% of network's hash power. I don't want to argue here if they have the motivation to collude with each other to cheat the network or whether the cost of hackers to destroy these pools would make them profitable or not. We just think it deviates our traditional blockchain value, so we need make some change.

### Why block DAG?
Our vison is simple, to truly achieve that is not that simple. The number of ways to make blockchain scalale, even infinitely scalable, are huge. The intuitive solutions are mainly consists of off-chain and centrailization and DAG, so we will explain why we choose DAG as our first option, at least on public chain side.
