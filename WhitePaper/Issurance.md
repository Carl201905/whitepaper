# Asset Issurance
Individuls or organizations are able to issure assets on HLC to increase the liquility and offer finicial services. Our solution is reliable, user-friendly and practical.
## Problem identification
### Asset compliance 
There is a contradiction between the openess of public blockchain and the compliance of assets issued on it. Blockchain is an autonomous peer-to-peer network, so there is no central authority to authorize who can join and leave. However, for a specific application scenario, we have to make sure the assets we issue is compliable on local law, saying, Muslics don't eat pork by their faith, so if someone wants to sell foods to Islamic market, how could he to convince his customers. 
### Value relevance
All the current assets issurance platforms, like ethereum, don't have a threshold to issure assets. So people could create assets whatever "market value" they want. Firstly it makes users hard to tell which asset is valuable or just a spam; secondly, abuse issurance increases the computation load and finally user will have to pay for it in the form of transaction fees.
## Problem analysis
### Asset compliance 
The problems of asset compliance is that the current solutions don't seperate application governance from consensus. Public blockchain itself is just a temper-proof ledger or database, so it is able to provide trustful computation services, which means the service will deliver what its code promises, so we could deem it as a technology problem. However, application governance is a bussiness problem and should be managed by the users rather than miners or developers. 
### Asset relevance
The cause of asset relevance problem is that the value of asset (tokens) and underlying currency (coin) don't  enter in a unified ecosystem. For instance, some token could be no connection with the ETH coin. In theory, this problem cannot be solved because we cannot estimate the market value of one toke, however, at least we should offer a benign mechanism that make tokens related to the coin, so it will encourgae the issuer to devote more value to gain more their customer's trust.
# Solution
OP_TOKEN is based on OP_GROUP, a referenced solution of issuring assets on Bitcoin Cash, and redesigned to fit various practical scenarios with unique features like asset compliable and value relevent.

## OP_TOKEN Design
The biggest difference between OP_TOKEN and OP_GROUP is that OP_TOKEN issues a special token named LICENSE. Licenses are hold by renowned expects or organizations with public credibility. Any entitity plans to issue a token needs to be warrant a license.
