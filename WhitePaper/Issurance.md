## Problem identification
### Asset compliance 
There is a contradiction between the openess of public blockchain and the compliance of assets issued on it. Blockchain is an autonomous peer-to-peer network, so there is no central authority to authorize who can join and leave. However, for a specific application scenario, we have to make sure the assets we issue is compliable on local law, saying, Muslics don't eat pork by their faith, so if someone wants to sell foods to Islamic market, how could he to convince his customers. 
### Value relevance
All the current assets issurance platforms, like ethereum, don't have a threshold to issure assets. So people could create assets whatever "market value" they want. Firstly it makes users hard to tell which asset is valuable or just a spam; secondly, abuse issurance increases the computation load and finally user will have to pay for it in the form of transaction fees.
