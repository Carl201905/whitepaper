# Section 2 Asset Management
There is no doubt that a high level of disruption by financial innovation has already started to reshape the global Islamic economy and the nature of payment practices; a new wave of disruption is making its way into asset management. The HLC public chainblockchain records provide pseudoanonymity, as all on-chain ownership is tracked via abstract public addresses, the ownership and provenance of assets can be easily tracked and overtime particular users may be identified. While privacy may be challenging to manage, for certain applications such transparency aspects can be helpful – for example from a regulatory and compliance perspective. The Corporate entities Individuls or organizations are able to issue their assets on HLC public chain platform to increase the liquility and offer finicial services. The HLc solution is reliable, user-friendly and practical especially in the Global Islamic economy and finance.
The main efforts in Islamic economics so far has been to create new forms Shariah compliance instruments to operationalise Shariah and ethical values into the current conventional economic system and financial services products. While this is crucial to sustain the global economy as it is today, the Islamic economics needs to develop new strategies to cope with the next economy, which starts with a clear and deliverable vision of a new world economy. And the new vision of a new world economy will be driven by those who embrace innovation that will build the future. 

However, it is necessary to look at the main building block to enable trust in impersonal financial transactions in a highly globalized society. This innovation called the “blockchain” will play a crucial role in boosting the Islamic financial sectors in all its segments which include banking, insurance, Capital market, Zakah and Waqf management. Addressing the digital revolution that is happening right now will foster competitive advantage for the Islamic economy and finance industry. This innovation is in accordance with Shariah rules and principles
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority. Simply put, it is a mechanism for creating trust. Within this open ledger system, the blockchain offers an inherent level of trust for the user, eliminating the need for the middleman and mitigating the risk of human error. Justice and creditworthiness has been emphasized in the Holy Quran in Surat al Nisa which Allah says: 
O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care of both. So do not follow your desires, lest you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away—then God is Aware of what you do” (4:135)
In the blockchain transaction, it is publicly accessible log of transactions ensures that the data is protected against tampering and revision, and it is virtually impossible for individuals to modify or replace parts of the blockchain secretly. The need for transparency, justice is, above all, an important Sharī`ah consideration in blockchain transaction. Any form of concealment, fraud or attempt at misrepresentation violates the principles of justice and fairness in Sharī`ah as mentioned in the Qur’an in Sūrah Al-Mutaffifin: 
Woe to the defrauders. Those who, when they take a measure from people, they take in full. But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat. (83: 1-3)
A full copy of the blockchain contains every transaction ever executed, making information on the value belonging to every active address (account) accessible at any point in history. Every block contains a long reference number or hash of the previous block, thus creating a chain of blocks from the genesis block to the current block. The below paragraphs explain the concept of blockchain and how a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, based on the cryptocurrency protocol.
 

The HLC public chain platform is one of the latest underlying technologies based on Directed Acyclic Graph which has been defined as Blockchain 3.0 technology. The DAG involves and supports quick transactions, and is friendly to small payment. This innovation shows that there is correlation between revealing civilization and blockchain consensus, which is transparency, justice, creditworthiness, trust and witness described in the Holy Quran and shared by the whole humanity. The public blockchain could act as a complete set of ecosystems to support start-ups in the Islamic digital economy and beyond. 


## Asset Compliance and Applicable use cases on HLC public chain
# HLC Stable Coin
There is a contradiction between the openess of public blockchain and the compliance of assets issued on it. Blockchain is an autonomous peer-to-peer network, so there is no central authority to authorize who can join and leave. However, for a specific application scenario, HLC have to make sure that the assets issued on HLC public chain platform are compliable with Shariah law principles. It is mentioned that innovation is important as the humanity are living in the age of technology and in an era of extreme innovation; with every passing day human being are harnessing new possibilities and existing opportunities using technology. Nowadays, one of the most talked-about topics in the financial services industry is to enable Capital markets, money markets and banks to process payments more quickly and more accurately while reducing the costs of processing transactions. However, The technology could be adopted in the area of Stable coin, sukuk, takaful, banking, waqf, zakat,etc.

## Concept of HLC Stable Coin

A stable coin is a currency which successfully performs its functions as a means of exchange, unit of account and a store of value because its purchasing power is stable. but is not tied to a central bank and has low volatility. On any given day, it is common to see an increase to 10-20% or even a decrease. That makes using most cryptocurrencies for daily transactions inconvenient. The adoption of stable currencies/coins will be a catalyst to the new decentralized internet becoming mainstream.
Stable coins is  core product is a Shariah compliant smart contract that represents an equity stake in Sukuk portfolio, which successfully combines traditional Islamic finance principles with those of mainstream finance. Stable Coin is a token whose smart contract represents the owners’ share in a financial fund formed by investment grade Sukuk. When consumers purchase the token, they are buying in to a fund of diversified Sukuk of high quality and high liquidity Sukuk.


### Features Of The Stable Coin 
 
Currency & Security As a currency, HLC is a system that enables payments settlement between two parties, directly, without the need of a central party to monitor transactions. Also, as a security, HLC is backed by investment grade Sukuk that allows the token to not only remain stable, but steadily appreciate in value, making it ideal as a savings instrument. HLC carries divisibility, homogeneity, portability and stability due to its asset-backed nature.

**Equity and Debt**  
As a token, Stable Coin represents an owner’s equity stake in a financial fund that is comprised of investment grade sukuk. We estimate that this fixed-income product will, return between 3-7% for retail investors, which is the average range for high quality sovereign and private Sukuk issuance. At the peak of its development, Fasset will also be able to support the raising of Shariah-Compliant debt for both corporates and sovereigns through its wider community of retail and institutional investors.  

**Stability  **
The final feature of the coin is in its stability. Backed by a real asset, the coin will not be subject to huge variations in price and thus will in effect become a form of stable coin. Coins will be issued 1:1 against the value of the Sukuk fund.

## Applicable uses of HLC Stable Coin 
The use of Blockchain technology holds great potential across the Islamic economy and finance industry. One of the key principles of Islamic economy is based on having enforceable contracts which are fair, transparent and agreeable between the parties that engage in a banking transaction.

**Payments**  
As a currency, Stable currency can be a payments system for goods and services. The Shariah-compliance and homogeneity offered by HLC can form as a reliable and low cost payments settlement vehicle for SMEs and large companies. 

**Transfers **
Our ecosystem will provide the infrastructure for an instantaneous international transfer system. The stability, portability and real world liquidity of Fasset will allow for fast, cost-less remittances across borders – especially given the fact that the Fasset ecosystem will be built on the DAG protocol (see Section 3: Technology Context for more information).  

**Savings** 
As of now, retail customers are unable to access the Sukuk market for long term savings - HLC will democratize access to a Shariah compliant fixed-income investment fund for retail consumers. The fixed-income nature of Sukuk and the divisibility offered by Fasset will allow retail investors to transfer their savings into Fasset for safe, secure and steady returns. 

**Liquid asset**  
Stable Coin can replace commodities such as copper that are required for debt based Shariah financing. Thus, HLC can accommodate many real-life transactions, for instances al Murabahah, Tawarruq, etc. 

**Liquidity management**  
Perhaps the most important use case for the HLC ecosystem will be in playing a vital role as a much-needed and oft-requested secondary market for the Islamic Finance industry. The speed, security and cost savings from encoding smart contracts using distributed ledger technology will provide strong options for liquidity management. This will enable numerous functions that have so far stalled the growth of Islamic Finance – such as inter-bank lending, monetary supply management by central banks and in enabling the development of other bespoke Shariah compliant institutional products.



### Value relevance
All the current assets issurance platforms, like ethereum, don't have a threshold to issure assets. So people could create assets whatever "market value" they want. Firstly it makes users hard to tell which asset is valuable or just a spam; secondly, abuse issurance increases the computation load and finally user will have to pay for it in the form of transaction fees.

## Problem analysis
### Asset compliance 
The challenges of asset compliance is that the current solutions don't seperate application governance from consensus. Public blockchain itself is just a temper-proof ledger or database, so it is able to provide trustful computation services, which means the service will deliver what its code promises, so we could deem it as a technology problem. However, application governance is a bussiness problem and should be managed by the users rather than miners or developers. 
### Asset relevance
The cause of asset relevance problem is that the value of asset (tokens) and underlying currency (coin) don't  enter in a unified ecosystem. For instance, some token could be no connection with the ETH coin. In theory, this problem cannot be solved because we cannot estimate the market value of one toke, however, at least we should offer a benign mechanism that make tokens related to the coin, so it will encourgae the issuer to devote more value to gain more their customer's trust.
# HLC Technology Solution
The HLC public chain is a powerful innovative technology that has the potential to transform the global Islamic financial services industry. it is a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared by corporate entities. HLC technology is cryptographically authentacated. it is developed to provide an alternative secure approach to exchange value without the involvement of third party. The technology enables simplification and brings in greater security, scaleability, speed, and reliability. The results is reduced costs and improved efficiency. 
OP_TOKEN is based on OP_GROUP, a referenced solution of issuring assets on Bitcoin Cash, and redesigned to fit various practical scenarios with unique features like asset compliable and value relevent.

## Related concepts
### UTXO
UTXO represents Unspent Transaction Output. One transaction has multiple sources and destinations, we call them as inputs and outpus. There are no accounts in HLC, what users have and spend are a bunch of unspent transaction ouputs and we could get  balance by summing up them. 

### Script system
The mechanism behind how users spend their UTXOs is to execute a special script. The output stores a half of the script and we have to present the other half and combine both to verify if we could spend the money. The former half is called locking script, like a locked treasure box, and the latter is unlocking script, like the only key to the box.

### Color coin
Color coin is a class of methods to represent assets on top of the blockchain, so it can leverage the temper-proof capibility of blockchain. It is like an organization issues their conference tickets with cash to make sure the tickets cannot be forged. There are a lot of ways to implement color coin and the most common way is to use a special script operation - OP_RETURN - to interupt script execution early, so we can add information of the assets after it without violating the script validation.

### OP_GROUP
The OP_RETURN scheme is more suitable to apply on mature blockchain since it doesn't change the underlying blockchain protocol and won't risk forking. However, the weakness OP_RETURN is that miners cannot verify its protocol so there would be some security risks.

OP_GROUP is a proposal of assets issurance  on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and has been approved by BU. OP_GROUP supports token issurance, tranfer, destroy, etc. Since OP_GROUP is an extention to BCH script sytem,  it is part of BCH protocol and can be verified by miners, which is more reliable.

### OP_TOKEN
HLC extends OP_GROUP, i.e. OP_TOKEN, to support assets authentication.

## OP_TOKEN Design
There is a special token named LICENSE in OP_TOKEN. Licenses are held by renowned expects or organizations with public credibility. Any entitity planing to issue a token needs to be warranted a license. Since license is also a token, it is able to be transfered between peers. However, license transfer can be tracked through transaction history, so the originator would be very cautious in case transfering to a wrong hand.

### Issue a license
Licenses are all generated in genesis block and distribted to 100 preserved committe members. One smallest unit of HLC (SAND) represents a license,  one block has 100 HLC,  1 HLC= 10^8   SAND , so we have 10 ^10 license in total, which is sufficient for asset issurance.

### warrant a license
Oraganizations must be warranted a license to issue assets. They can request license from any committe member. Once approved, they would receive a special token transfer from the commitee member and the token is the license.
### Issurance assets
Once warranted a license, organizations are able to issue assets. Assets cannot be built from the air, they required equal amount smallest unit (sand) of HLC to be converted. We also call the process as token mint. Just like to mint a gold coin requires the same weight of gold sands, tokens need same amount HLC sands. The advantage is not only that the token has a value support by underlying currency but also that all tokens and HLC are invovled in the same ecosytem, which would improve the liquidity and make whole network healthier.

### Transfer
Assets can be transfered between parties. Moreover, we could transfer mulitple assets within one transaction. The transaction needs to ensure the  input sum of each asset equals the output sum of each asset. 


### Unmint
In addition to mint token, we can unmint token. Like we cannot build token from nothing, we cannot destroy tokens into ashes, instead, we melt  tokens into HLC. Also, tokens can be melt into the same amount of HLC sands. So, tokens have minimum value sustain. 

HLC encourages token holders to increase their token values rather than unminting them. But there are some scenarios to make unminting practical, such as stable coins. So, HLC only allow the token issuer to umint tokens.
